 touhou_GATHERING_STORM_NAME:0 "Entering Gensokyo"
 touhou_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "In 1936, the world was gradually moving towards darkness, and a sudden change silently erupted. A brand new and unknown area has appeared in the Sea of Japan, where not only do humans no different from this world live, but also numerous types of youkai with supernatural powers. The investigation team dispatched by mankind was stopped at the edge of the mysterious area, seemingly obstructed by some invisible barrier. But even after such a change, humanity remained immersed in deceit; in Europe, Hitler consolidated his authority and set his sights on regions outside of Germany. Mussolini's Italy continued to embark on bold military adventures, while the Japanese Empire was ready to attack China. Nearly twenty years have passed since the end of the Great War, and humanity has yet to learn its lesson, once again turning the world into a powder keg. But this time, with the addition of new members, the direction of fate will become even more confusing."

 ALI_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "In the early stages of the incident in Gensokyo, Alice was the first to discover this incident because she had lost contact with Makai, and together with the sage council, attempted to prevent it. After the failed attempt to prevent the incident, she was thrown into this world along with Gensokyo. As one of the earliest people to discover the incident, Alice's preparation was greater but still insufficient. In the process of preventing the incident and being thrown into the new world afterwards, Alice lost almost all of her puppet servants. Fortunately, although the magic in this world is rare, it can still meet the needs of survival. Although the materials in this world do not contain magic and the craftsmanship does not have magical elements, it is still possible to make autonomous dolls. Alice still has a chance to recover, but it will take time. On the other side of Makai, everyone was anxious because they suddenly lost contact with Alice. Now their biggest headache is how to hide it from Shinki, or how to persuade Shinki not to turn countless worlds upside down just to find Alice."
 VAM_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Although the Scarlet family has always been one of the main forces in Gensokyo, the rule of Remilia is by no means stable. There is a Vampire Council lurking outside, ready to regain power at any time. There is also a strong claim to the title of Count within, and although everyone understands that she has no intention of seizing power, there are always people with intentions to use her. In terms of military affairs, the Dragon and Tiger Guards, which were previously authorized to be formed by Hong Meiling to confront the Vampire Council, were strong enough that the lower level Vampire Clan could not resist and seem to have become her private army. Fortunately, it seems that she is still relatively loyal at present. In terms of politics, Patchouli, who has made great contributions to the family, has shown signs of becoming a powerful figure and is gradually taking over the reins of power. There is a subtle trend towards regency, and although Koakuma's private army is not strong, it is still a force. Fortunately, the presence of the Sakuya temporarily relieved her of the need to worry about whether her drinks were poisonous. This Gensokyo incident is both an opportunity and a challenge for Remilia, and whether she can seize it depends on herself."
 TEN_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "In Gensokyo, the Tengu have always been in a state of internal pressure and external isolation, with severe racial stratification within. Thanks to the nightmare of being enslaved by the Oni tribe in the past, the Tengu still maintain an almost fanatical unity and exclusion. After becoming the largest force in Youkai Mountain, they also began to pursue hegemony and began to oppress their fellow countrymen who were previously enslaved by the Oni - the Kappa. The Tengu appears to be powerful and mysterious race, with a high degree of cohesion, but the oppressed lower level Tengu and Kappa have their complaints. With the world entering a period of change and external ideologies surging in, can the Tengu still maintain stability? Where will the lower level Tengu go?"
 TEM_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Myouren Temple has always been a staunch advocate of equality between humans and youkai, and it has indeed done so. However, the long-standing animosity between humans and youkai cannot be resolved simply by living under the same roof. Although the two sides appear to be harmonious on the surface, there are still ups and downs behind their backs. What kind of catalyst will this incident become and what kind of reaction will it promote between the two factions?"
 RAB_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The people of Eientei have long been accustomed to wandering, so they have hardly been affected. However, the youkai rabbits who have been living a reclusive life in the Bamboo Forest of the Lost are completely unable to calm down, especially the leader of the youkai rabbits, Tewi Inaba. Perhaps relying on luck, experience, or something else, she sensed a strange fate and began actively guiding the change. On the other hand, the Lunarians who had lost their power began to lose control of their opponents, and Reisen was accepted by the youkai rabbits. The Lunar Princess also began to try to adapt to the new environment, her long history gave her wisdom but made it difficult for her to adapt to the new changes, so she still needed time. At the time of entering the world, the secret lunar communication route located in Eientei lost control and bypassed the Great Hakurei Barrier, directly connecting to the outside world. Eientei not only lost contact with the lunar support forces, but also had to directly face external threats. What will be the future of Eientei?"
 OPP_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Gensokyo's incident has even affected its Hell. Hell was completely thrown onto land and lost contact with the nine other Yama. As the only Yama present in Gensokyo's hell, Eiki Shiki rightfully became the supreme ruler. On the day Eiki ascended to power, she issued the highly controversial law of 'Reincarnation of undead in the World'. According to the law, all undead must work in Hell and Hakugyokurou before entering hell to perform redemption. Eiki is well aware that these undead do not come from this world. It is better to say that there are no undead in this world, but Eiki herself is not sure where these undead come from or where they go."
 SSS_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Since entering Gensokyo, the Moriya Shrine has become a strong competitor to the Hakurei Shrine, almost taking away all of the Hakurei faith. However, Moriya has never been able to secure the coveted position of the guardian of Gensokyo, and from the situation, they do not intend to give up this opportunity."
 MLS_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "This morning, when Marisa knocked on the door for the first time and came in, I knew I had much more trouble than my shop being smashed to pieces\" - Rinnosuke's Diary (On the Day of Gensokyo's incident)"
 KAP_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Compared to other races in Youkai Mountain, the individual strength of each Kappa is relatively weak, so they chose to strengthen themselves through technology. However, in this process, the strengthening of their physical forms was gradually replaced by the pursuit of the unknown and the pleasure of creation. Nowadays, the Kappa are simply a group of technology thugs who do not care about anything except for the sake of science. Kappa were oppressed by both the Oni tribe and the Tengu. At first, they rose up to resist, but they became addicted to technology (detonating their own laboratory), and later began to enjoy themselves. If it weren't for this incident, where the Tengu seriously hindered the Kappa's exploration of the unknown, perhaps this situation would never have changed."
 HUM_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The humans who were most affected by this incident were the ones inside. They found that there were still so many compatriots outside who are not oppressed by youkai. In addition, after the incident, the power of youkai was greatly weakened. Many people inside the Human Village began to try to get rid of the influence of youkai. However, since there are those who pursue independence, there are also those who fear change and are content with the status quo, and the Sage Council also supports these stubborn factions behind the scenes. At the same time, there are also many people who sympathize with the youkai and have maintained friendly relations with them. But no matter what, this time there will be a huge change in people's lives."
 HEL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Oni tribe only cares about two things; alcohol and battle. This incident is the same for them everywhere, whether it's in Gensokyo or outside. It's better to say that the Oni tribe actually enjoys their current state more; a larger variety of alcohol and more opponents to fight."
 HAK_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "As the entrance to the underworld, Hakugyokurou began to play the role of hell after the abandonment of Old Hell. It also holds a certain position in Gensokyo due to the support of Yuyuko, serving as a link between Gensokyo and Hell. After the incident, although Hell quickly regained stability, the control of Hakugyokurou by Hell without the support of the nine other realms of hell was greatly reduced. This was an opportunity for Yuyuko and Youmu to escape from Hell and control the Netherworld, but things were not that simple."
 EVI_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Fairies don't care about so-called incidents, as long as they have fun, they don't care about anything else."
 DLD_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The satori have been diligently managing Old Hell, whether it was after it was abandoned by Hell or after the arrival of the Oni tribe. They paid a huge price to obtain and establish an underground nuclear furnace for Old Hell, filling the energy gap left by Higan's abandonment. After Hell attempted to seize the underground nuclear furnace, they completely broke away. The number of satori has been continuously decreasing, and coupled with their ability to read minds, no one is willing to deal with them. In order to relieve loneliness, Chireiden has raised a large number of youkai, including very powerful types. Although it was not the original purpose, the warcraft did make significant contributions to protecting Chireiden."
 DES_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Divine Spirit Mausoleum was originally located in a different realm and was greatly influenced by the world's entry. Some buildings and objects that originally relied on special phenomena in the other realm collapsed, and numerous artifacts painstakingly crafted and collected by the hermits were also destroyed in this catastrophe. Their archenemy, Myouren Temple, was watching closely from the side. Now they must take action, for survival and for the glory of the Hall of Dreams' Great Mausoleum."
 BLI_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "If you have to choose a force that can represent Gensokyo, then it is the Hakurei Shrine. Both the Hakurei Shrine and Gensokyo were established to resist external threats and maintain stability internally. Hakurei priestesses have always been regarded as the guardians of Gensokyo and hold a high position within it. However, this incident was a huge blow to Hakurei beliefs, as entering Gensokyo meant that it was no longer independent of the world. Fortunately, although there is a breach in Muenzuka, the Great Hakurei Barrier still plays a role. Gensokyo and the outside world can only be connected through the entrance and exit of the Hakurei Shrine, the breach in Muenzuka, and Hell, which is not within the Great Hakurei Barrier. The barrier's reaction at Eientei is also a bit strange, but Eirin refuses to begin an investigation and promises that everything is under control. Where will the future of Hakurei and Gensokyo go?"
