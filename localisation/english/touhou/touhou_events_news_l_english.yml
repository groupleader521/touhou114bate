Although Medicine stated that Alice committed suicide, the reporter had seen a similar figure in the Garden of the Sun while attempting to interview Yuuka Kazami, so she did not comment much"

In addition, the reporter found that since the completion of the brewery, all the people of the entire Oni tribe have flocked to the brewery to taste the newly brewed wine, causing a situation of crowds.

They have sent the same diplomatic order to each force, but the entire letter only mentions the Tengu. That is to say, at least for now, only the Tengu are directly threatened by the Oni tribe.

The Nuclear Furnace is the foundation for the survival of Chireiden and even all of old hell. After abandoning old hell, it was built at a huge cost by the satori and they have been guarding it from Hell until now. However, it is surprising that the Nuclear Furnace, which is so important, is willing to be shared by Chireiden. The report sent by frontline reporters shows that Chireiden is willing to share the energy produced by the Nuclear Furnace with other forces except for Hell and the Netherworld, in exchange for shelter and living space. Although several forces have previously expressed their continued interest in the agreement, no force has officially given a positive response. It is speculated that on the one hand, there is concern about the attitude of Hell, and on the other hand, there are still doubts about this matter and they are keeping a wait-and-see attitude"

From then on, the previously rumored 'Satori Migration Plan' officially surfaced. According to relevant sources, this move is not surprising, mainly because the environment of Old Hell is not particularly suitable for the survival of satori. Although it is not bad, it is definitely not comfortable. In order to revive satori and expand their population, they must migrate to more comfortable places. Although there have been no further actions taken by Chireiden since the announcement, there is evidence to suggest that they are actively expanding their military capabilities and are likely to take action soon"

According to frontline reporters, there was nothing particularly special about this tribute, and even the scale was reduced compared to before the incident, but this did not prevent Tengu from promoting it vigorously. According to relevant personnel analysis, the political significance of this ceremony far outweighs its practical significance. The main purpose is to announce to the entire Gensokyo that Tengu still holds onto the Kappa firmly, and the Kappa have no plans to change this situation"

Throughout the years, the Kappa have been firmly controlled by the Tengu and has been represented by Tengu in matters including diplomacy. The Kappa delegation is the first independent contact between the Kappa and other forces.

Although the reason for the Netherworld's absence is still unclear, it undoubtedly increases suspicion from the outside world. Previously, a relevant person analyzed; 'Given the close relationship between the current leader of the Netherworld and a certain sage of the Sage Council, the Netherworld is very likely to take this opportunity to break free from the control of Hell and join the embrace of the Sage Council.'

Unlike the previous Gensokyo Conference hosted by the Wise Men's Council, the main members of this meeting are experts who have dealt with incidents in the past, and the topics mainly revolve around solving the world's transformation and how to maintain order in this situation. Although the Hakurei Shrine has made tremendous efforts in all aspects, the talks have had little effect, and in the newly started round of negotiations, the attendance rate is even lower than half. At present, apart from the Hakurei Shrine, only the Xianglin Hall has a positive attitude, while the people are trying to seek refuge and have a cold attitude towards maintaining order. According to insiders, Alice also left the workshop very rarely and attended the meeting, reaching an agreement with the Hakurei Shrine on certain issues. However, Alice herself has not yet made a public appearance and has not given any response to the rumor"

However, the reporter found that due to the current tense situation, although various forces are highly concerned about this grand event, their attitude towards participation is indifferent. The vast majority of exhibition areas are just some commonplace small things, and some exhibition areas are even empty. Nevertheless, this expo still became the focal point of the entire Gensokyo with only three active exhibition areas. The Eientei exhibition area, with the ultra modern technology of Yuedu, provides people with a dream like experience; Although Alice herself was unable to attend, the puppet workshop exhibition area led by Penglai has the largest number of staff and no other equipment. With dolls alone, it is possible to achieve nanometer level accuracy, which makes people marvel at the power of electronic technology and automation; The Kappa's exihibition fully embodies the charm of heavy equipment, with the largest floor area among all exhibition areas, and it can be filled with heavy equipment without waste. The only drawback is the need to wear special protective clothing provided by the Kappa and be prepared for explosions at any time"

The reporter immediately took action and found during a visit to the lost bamboo forest that the rabbit youkai that were once everywhere in the forest were now difficult to find, and a large area was designated as a military control zone. The spokesperson of Yongting responded that this is only a military exercise conducted to protect themselves in response to the current tense situation. However, the reporter found a large number of traces of large-scale mobilization of heavy armed forces, and the spokesperson of Yongting still insists that it is only a military exercise and there is no rhetoric against anyone"

At present, the purpose of this move is not clear, although there are signs of military mobilization, it is concentrated towards Yongting, so the possibility of attacking other forces is not high. According to relevant sources' analysis, when the world first entered, abnormal fluctuations in space were observed in Eientei, and this series of abnormal behaviors in Eientei are likely related to it"

As one of the few forces in Gensokyo with the ability to hold the largest banquet, the Scarlet Devil Mansion held multiple banquets before entering this world, so this grand banquet also received widespread response. According to relevant sources' analysis, the Scarlet Devil Mansion opened its base to hold a grand banquet in such a tense environment to convey a signal to the outside world that it prefers fine wine over blood. Although the Scarlet Devil Mansion has always been a strong competitor for the hegemony of the demon power, judging from the banquet, they no longer have any plans to continue competing for supremacy"

However, another major giant of the demon power, the Tengu power, refused to respond to this matter"

 news.1021.d:0 "At the beginning of Moriya's announcement that all branches under their umbrella would be open to believers of all religions for free, everyone believed that this was another new tactic of Moriya's persecution of infidels. However, earlier on, Byakuren Hijiri, the head of Myouren Temple, used the cable car provided by Moriya to return to Myouren Temple from the shrine, becoming the first non-believer to use Moriya's facilities. In fact, the Myouren Temple is not located near the Moriya Shrine. Passing through the Moriya Shrine will only increase the distance in vain, so this move has no practical significance. However, its symbolic significance is unprecedentedly enormous. Ms. Hijiri expressed that she is willing to believe that the actions of the Moriya Shrine are out of goodwill and is willing to prove it. This has also led to a new interpretation of the purpose of the Shouya Shrine policy by the outside world"

The reporter learned that the tour route of this sightseeing group mainly focuses on the outskirts of Youkai Mountain and will not enter deeper areas. Related scholars say that this is an attempt by Tengu to change the completely closed and exclusive status quo of Tengu society. Youkai Mountain has always been known for its beautiful scenery and the fact that once you step in, you will be immediately expelled by Tengu. Therefore, it is surprising that Tengu took the initiative to invite foreigners to visit. In addition, our reporter found during our visit that there are many dissatisfied people in the Tengu Camp. Perhaps it is precisely because of this that the tour group chose the outer route. It seems that Tengu still needs some time to work hard to complete the opening"

All foreigners in Youkai Mountain are expelled, and the freedom to use non lethal weapons and the limited threat of using lethal weapons are open to unarmed personnel.

This ritual was independently planned and organized by Myouren Temple, inviting members from all races in the Gensokyo, with the aim of comforting the many creatures who sacrificed themselves in the world's transformation. Although the relationship between humans and youkai was severely opposed due to the influence of the world, both sides exercised restraint during this ritual, so the ritual ended successfully without any unexpected incidents.

Myouren Temple has always been committed to creating an equal environment for humans and youkai, and has always strived to solve problems through dialogue, so this move is truly puzzling"

After the reporter's visit, it was found that the vast majority of these Taoist priests come from the temple of gods and are practitioners of the temple. These Taoists provide assistance to humans regardless of their power, while persuading them to stay away from youkai, and even when facing youkai, they maintain great restraint. The Taoists had been practicing in seclusion in the temple of gods before, taking it as their duty to become immortals and never caring about worldly affairs.

Human beings have always been the focus of competition among various forces, with youkai feeding on the fear they produce, and religious factions relying on them to provide faith and disciples. Of course, compared to youkai, people are more welcoming to religious forces that are also human. According to relevant sources' analysis, this move by Renli is mainly a self-defense measure against the escalating tension recently, by showing goodwill to major religious sects in order to gain greater support. However, in the current situation, major forces are struggling to protect themselves and cannot determine how much positive effect this move will bring. It can be foreseen that further actions will be taken within the people to win over all parties"

However, regardless, the bill has been officially promulgated among the people and is steadily progressing.

Before the establishment of the Doll Workshop, Alice was renowned throughout Gensokyo for her stunning doll creations. There were also rumors that Alice's own beauty was not inferior to her dolls, but due to the dangerous environment of the Magic Forest, few people were able to see her true form. Later, the doll workshop was established, and Alice's dolls gradually began to enter the public eye, becoming one of the top gifts in high society. However, due to all the dolls being handmade by Alice herself, they have always been in short supply. According to incomplete statistics, the number of gifts presented this time is even larger than the total number sold or given away by doll workshops in the past decade. Although doll workshops have a tradition of giving doll gifts before, such a large scale is unprecedented. According to relevant sources' analysis, Alice's move is intended to ease the current tense situation as much as possible, and it is also a powerful counterattack against the widely circulated rumor that Alice has died recently"

According to eyewitnesses' accounts, the dolls often appear in corners that are not usually noticed, or in concealed places such as grass or piles of debris. Additionally, all eyewitnesses have stated that those dolls face outward and closely monitor everything that comes and goes. When someone notices them, they disappear at some point and return to the vicinity of the discovery site a few days later, although they often change positions and become more difficult to spot. Even some restricted or highly confidential areas have witnessed testimonies. At present, in order to avoid further leaks, several forces have started to search for these dolls.

After hearing the news of the leader's appointment, the entire Gensokyo was boiling with excitement, and everyone spontaneously took to the streets to celebrate. This grand occasion reminds me of the days when the Supreme Leader led his confidants on a tour of Gensokyo and had friendly exchanges with heroes. Although there were occasional conflicts, they relied on the great charisma of the leader to win over people with virtue. Every time they visited a place, the locals would welcome them through the streets. The only one who can lead us is the Supreme Leader. Long live the leader! hooray! Ten thousand years old! In addition, all the rumors of protests, riots, rallies, etc. that you have heard are groundless. There is no one in the Gensokyo who does not support the newly appointed supreme leader. What you hear at home is not the sound of gunshots or cannons, but the excited people setting off firecrackers to celebrate, and the soaring flames are the bonfires of celebration. This newspaper kindly reminds readers to stay indoors, close doors and windows tightly. No matter how excited they are, please do not join the carnival outside until the new government's army takes you out of your house. Thank you for your cooperation"

According to an anonymous source, the Council of Wise Men had identified potential signs that could have led to the current situation a long time ago, but did not take any action. It is unclear whether this was due to an agreement between the Council of Wise Men and the council. At present, it is unclear what impact this incident will have on Gensokyo and the outside world.

Its content is modern, even with advanced understanding of various social theories, but its core is quite ancient, even able to trace the description of the golden age shared by myths of various countries.

I have signed another round of mobilization orders to send more young people to the battlefield, or more precisely, to hell. On the square, people surrounded me. I dare not lift my head - I am ashamed to look into the eyes of those mothers and wives. A young lady walked up to me, holding a child. I dare not speak out, I am afraid she will ask me when to send this child to hell - to see his father. She patted my shoulder, 'We can't give up yet.'
