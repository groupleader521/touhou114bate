 nstouhou.1.d:0 "Just a few hours ago, frontline reporters sent a report claiming that the troops in Gensokyo Township had withdrawn from Purple Cherry. As of the time of writing, the battle is still ongoing, and the troops in Gensokyo continue to launch fierce attacks on outsiders, attempting to recapture Purple Cherry. However, under the continuous influx of external troops into Gensokyo, they have shown signs of fatigue. According to relevant sources' analysis, the troops in Gensokyo will continue to attack at any cost, and their opponents will also do their best to counterattack. It can be foreseen that the battle for purple cherry blossoms will continue for some time. But now, this place is no longer in the hands of the Gensokyo"

As of the time of writing, the battle is still ongoing, and the troops in Gensokyo continue to launch fierce attacks on outsiders, attempting to regain the Ministry of Right and Wrong. However, under the continuous influx of external troops into Gensokyo, they have shown signs of fatigue. According to relevant sources' analysis, the troops in Gensokyo will continue to attack at any cost, and their opponents will also do their best to counterattack. It can be foreseen that the battle for the right and wrong will continue for some time. But now, this place is no longer in the hands of the Gensokyo"

 nstouhou.3.t:0 "Entering the Barrier"
 nstouhou.3.d:0 "Just a few hours ago, frontline reporters sent a report claiming that the troops in Gensokyo were unable to hold onto Eientei. As of press time, the battle is still ongoing, and the troops in Gensokyo are launching fierce attacks against outsiders in an attempt to recapture Eientei. However, under the continuous influx of external troops into Gensokyo, they have shown signs of fatigue.

 nstouhou.3.c:0 "It should be blocked"
 nstouhou.4.t:0 "The barrier has been breached"
 nstouhou.4.d:0 "Just a few hours ago, frontline reporters sent a report claiming that the entrance and exit of the Great Barrier at the Hakurei Shrine had been breached. As of press time, the battle is still ongoing, and the troops in Gensokyo are launching fierce attacks against outsiders, attempting to recapture the entrance and exit of the Great Barrier. However, under the continuous influx of external troops from Gensokyo, they have shown signs of fatigue. According to relevant sources' analysis, the troops in Gensokyo will continue to attack at any cost, and their opponents will also do their best to counterattack. It can be foreseen that the battle for the entrance and exit of the Great Barrier will continue for some time. But now, this place is no longer in the hands of the Gensokyo"
 nstouhou.4.a:0 "The open door"
 nstouhou.4.b:0 "Great Hakurei Barrier! No"
 nstouhou.4.c:0 "I never thought there would be such a day"
 
 nstouhou.5.t:0 "Alice's recovery"
 nstouhou.5.d:0 "After a long period of silence, Alice finally made another public appearance. Previously, the outside world had been speculating whether Alice was seriously injured due to the influence of fantasy. Alice herself did not provide any response to this and immediately closed her doors at the doll workshop after her public appearance, burying herself in researching doll techniques. However, at least for now, Alice shows no signs of injury"
 nstouhou.5.a:0 "Fortune and misfortune are known by heaven"
 nstouhou.6.t:0 "Alice defeats Medicine Melancholy again"
 nstouhou.6.d:0 "Once again, under the banner of the puppet liberation front, Medicine launched an attack on Alice. According to reporters sent to the battlefield, Alice still emerged victorious this time. Medicine retreated to the Garden of the Sun once again. As of the time of writing, Yuuka Kazami has stated that she will continue to take care of Medicine until she can be on her own. Alice, as before, did not pursue any further investigation. In summary, just like their countless previous confrontations, there has been no change"
 nstouhou.6.a:0 "This matter is unremarkable and unremarkable"
 nstouhou.7.t:0 "Alice was defeated by Medicine Melancholy"
 nstouhou.7.d:0 "When Medicine launched another attack on Alice under the banner of the puppet liberation front, everyone believed that this time would end in failure like countless others before. However, according to the reporters sent to the battlefield, this time it was Medicine who won, while Alice disappeared without a trace. Recently, Medicine has settled into the Doll House, and Alice's puppet unit has all accepted Medicine's adaptation, including Shanghai dolls and Hourai dolls. At this point, the puppet workshop has completed the adaptation without losing any strength. As of press time, Yuuka Kazami has not yet expressed any opinion on this matter. Although Medicine stated that Alice committed suicide, the reporter had seen a similar figure in the Garden of the Sun while attempting to interview Yuuka Kazami, so she did not comment much"
 nstouhou.7.a:0 "Alice!? Is that Alice? She actually lost"
 nstouhou.8.t:0 "Gensokyo Unification"
 nstouhou.8.d:0 "Urgent news. The mainland that suddenly appeared in the Sea of Japan seems to have completed unification recently. Since the beginning of the war, the smoke of gunpowder covering the continent has also dissipated. The new country called itself Gensokyo and officially began diplomatic activities with countries around the world. However, due to the existence of the mysterious force that separated this continent from our world, we still know nothing about the situation inside Gensokyo"
 nstouhou.8.a:0 "Interesting"
 nstouhou.9.t:0 "The New Deal of Hell"
 nstouhou.9.d:0 "Recently, Hell issued an official statement to the public. The statement indicates that Hell will engage with other forces in Gensokyo in a completely new manner in the future. According to insiders' analysis, the sudden change in the foreign policy of Hell is related to the significant changes in its political structure. In addition, the newly empowered Yama seems to have doubts about the high-pressure policies of Hell, which directly contributed to this change"
 nstouhou.9.a:0 "There won't be any new wars"
 nstouhou.10.t:0 "The Yama reaffirms ownership of hell"
 nstouhou.10.d:0 "Recently, the political restructuring in Hell has just ended, and a statement has been issued again condemning the illegal armed occupation of Old Hell by the satori and Oni tribes. And the satori, like before, publicly condemned Hell's invasion of their homeland. Of course, the relationship between the two parties has not changed and remains below freezing point"
 nstouhou.10.a:0 "Same as before"
 nstouhou.11.t:0 "The Old City Brewery has been completed"
 nstouhou.11.d:0 "Recently, the Oni tribe has officially completed the large-scale construction of a brewery in the old capital and started supplying fine wine. The reporter was fortunate enough to be invited to attend the completion ceremony of the brewery. During the ceremony, the leader of the Oni tribe announced that they would further expand their scale and produce a wider variety of fine wines to meet the needs of the Oni. In addition, the reporter found that since the completion of the brewery, all the people of the entire Oni tribe have flocked to the brewery to taste the newly brewed wine, causing a situation of crowds. It can be foreseen that for a very long time in the future, they will no longer have any interest in returning to the ground"
 nstouhou.11.a:0 "The Tengu can rest assured now"
 nstouhou.12.t:0 "The Oni tribe demands tribute from the Tengu"
 nstouhou.12.d:0 "After the first establishment of a diplomatic office by the Oni tribe and the formal establishment of diplomatic relations with other forces. He eagerly issued a diplomatic order, threatening war and demanding that the Tengu offer a large amount of fine wine as tribute. However, the Oni tribe still doesn't understand what diplomacy is. They have sent the same diplomatic order to each force, but the entire letter only mentions the Tengu. That is to say, at least for now, only the Tengu are directly threatened by the Oni tribe. As of press time, the Tengu government has not responded and has refused to make any comments"
 nstouhou.12.a:0 "What the Tengu were worried about has happened"
 nstouhou.13.t:0 "Nuclear Furnace Cooperation Agreement"
 nstouhou.13.d:0 "The framework of the cooperation agreement for the Nuclear Furnace of Chireiden, which has been receiving much attention, was finally officially released yesterday. The Nuclear Furnace is the foundation for the survival of Chireiden and even all of old hell. After abandoning old hell, it was built at a huge cost by the satori and they have been guarding it from Hell until now. However, it is surprising that the Nuclear Furnace, which is so important, is willing to be shared by Chireiden. The report sent by frontline reporters shows that Chireiden is willing to share the energy produced by the Nuclear Furnace with other forces except for Hell and the Netherworld, in exchange for shelter and living space. Although several forces have previously expressed their continued interest in the agreement, no force has officially given a positive response. It is speculated that on the one hand, there is concern about the attitude of Hell, and on the other hand, there are still doubts about this matter and they are keeping a wait-and-see attitude"
 nstouhou.13.a:0 "Someone will be interested"
 nstouhou.14.t:0 "The Satori Claim Land"
 nstouhou.14.d:0 "The satori who have been living underground all along suddenly issued a statement yesterday, officially claiming the land on the ground. From then on, the previously rumored 'Satori Migration Plan' officially surfaced. According to relevant sources, this move is not surprising, mainly because the environment of Old Hell is not particularly suitable for the survival of satori. Although it is not bad, it is definitely not comfortable. In order to revive satori and expand their population, they must migrate to more comfortable places. Although there have been no further actions taken by Chireiden since the announcement, there is evidence to suggest that they are actively expanding their military capabilities and are likely to take action soon"
 nstouhou.14.a:0 "Finally revealing his fangs"
 nstouhou.15.t:0 "Kappa Celebrate with Tribute to the Tengu"
 nstouhou.15.d:0 "Recently, The Kappa and Tengu publicly held their first tribute ceremony after the world's incident. According to frontline reporters, there was nothing particularly special about this tribute, and even the scale was reduced compared to before the incident, but this did not prevent Tengu from promoting it vigorously. According to relevant personnel analysis, the political significance of this ceremony far outweighs its practical significance. The main purpose is to announce to the entire Gensokyo that Tengu still holds onto the Kappa firmly, and the Kappa have no plans to change this situation"
 nstouhou.15.a:0 "The Tengu will be very happy"
 nstouhou.16.t:0 "Kappa Delegation"
 nstouhou.16.d:0 "At the recently concluded multilateral talks, a Kappa delegate appeared for the first time. Throughout the years, the Kappa have been firmly controlled by the Tengu and has been represented by Tengu in matters including diplomacy. The Kappa delegation is the first independent contact between the Kappa and other forces. At present, the reason for this change is still unclear, but it can be foreseen that the Kappa are trying to weaken the control of the Tengu and make contact with other forces in the Gensokyo independently"
 nstouhou.16.a:0 "Things have become interesting"
 nstouhou.17.t:0 "Hakugyokurou attends the Netherworld Congress"
 nstouhou.17.d:0 "The first Netherworld congress after the reorganization of Hell recently came to an end in the Ministry of Right and Wrong, with representatives from the Netherworld attending. This indicates that the Netherworld officially recognizes the newly reorganized Yama Ministry regime as the legitimate regime of the afterlife. In addition, a spokesperson for the Netherworld also stated after the meeting that the 'Hell Agreement' is still valid in the current situation and that they will continue to fulfill the obligations stipulated therein. Previously, there were concerns that the Netherworld would attempt to become independent and that the entrance of the underworld would be controlled by the Sage Council. However, based on the current situation, there seems to be some unfounded concern"
 nstouhou.17.a:0 "The Yama will be happy"
 nstouhou.18.t:0 "Hakugyokurou is absent from the Netherworld Conference"
 nstouhou.18.d:0 "The first Netherworld conference after the reorganization of Hell recently came to an end in the Ministry of Right and Wrong, and the Netherworld was absent from the conference. Although the reason for the Netherworld's absence is still unclear, it undoubtedly increases suspicion from the outside world. Previously, a relevant person analyzed; 'Given the close relationship between the current leader of the Netherworld and a certain sage of the Sage Council, the Netherworld is very likely to take this opportunity to break free from the control of Hell and join the embrace of the Sage Council.' According to the latest information, there have been suspected sage individuals entering and leaving the Netherworld recently, but the Netherworld has refused to respond to this"
 nstouhou.18.a:0 "The sages have begun to take action"
 nstouhou.19.t:0 "Fairy Paradise expansion"
 nstouhou.19.d:0 "The expansion project of Fairy Paradise has been fully completed recently, and the reporter was fortunate to attend the completion ceremony. Although it was a ceremony, it was more like a banquet. According to the situation learned by the reporter, fairies are still only interested in games, and this world clearly provides them with more entertainment projects, which is also the main purpose of the expansion of Fairy Park; to include more entertainment projects"
 nstouhou.19.a:0 "I hope they can be more obedient"
 nstouhou.20.t:0 "Fairy Conference"
 nstouhou.20.d:0 "Recently, the Fairy Conference held at Misty Lake officially concluded, marking the first time that all participants were fairies, and therefore the reporter was not allowed to participate. However, according to informed sources, although the conference did not have any substantive content 99% of the time, it still reached a consensus on causing trouble for the Scarlet Devil Mansion. Although the vast majority of fairies do not care about the reasons, based on their previous performance, the possibility of striving for independence is very high, even if they do not understand what independence is"
 nstouhou.20.a:0 "The Scarlet Devil Manion is going to have a headache"
 nstouhou.21.t:0 "Hakurei Talks"
 nstouhou.21.d:0 "The talks organized by the Hakurei Shrine were held as scheduled at the Hakurei Shrine recently. Unlike the previous Gensokyo Conference hosted by the Wise Men's Council, the main members of this meeting are experts who have dealt with incidents in the past, and the topics mainly revolve around solving the world's transformation and how to maintain order in this situation. Although the Hakurei Shrine has made tremendous efforts in all aspects, the talks have had little effect, and in the newly started round of negotiations, the attendance rate is even lower than half. At present, apart from the Hakurei Shrine, only the Xianglin Hall has a positive attitude, while the people are trying to seek refuge and have a cold attitude towards maintaining order. According to insiders, Alice also left the workshop very rarely and attended the meeting, reaching an agreement with the Hakurei Shrine on certain issues. However, Alice herself has not yet made a public appearance and has not given any response to the rumor"
 nstouhou.21.a:0 "They are still working hard"
 nstouhou.22.t:0 "Notice from Hakurei Shrine"
 nstouhou.22.d:0 "After a long period of upheaval, the representative of the Hakurei Shrine finally made a formal speech publicly. In the speech, Hakurei Shrine warned all forces in Gensokyo to abide by their own rules, otherwise Hakurei Shrine, as the guardian of Gensokyo, will use all means to maintain order. At the same time as the speech, various factions in Gensokyo also received an official announcement from the Hakurei Shrine. It can be foreseen that the Red Killer will soon make a comeback in the martial arts world"
 nstouhou.22.a:0 "Be careful"
 nstouhou.23.t:0 "Eientei Technology Expo"
 nstouhou.23.d:0 "Recently, the Eientei Technology Expo officially kicked off in Eientei, marking the first time such an event has appeared in the Gensokyo, thus attracting high attention from all parties. However, the reporter found that due to the current tense situation, although various forces are highly concerned about this grand event, their attitude towards participation is indifferent. The vast majority of exhibition areas are just some commonplace small things, and some exhibition areas are even empty. Nevertheless, this expo still became the focal point of the entire Gensokyo with only three active exhibition areas. The Eientei exhibition area, with the ultra modern technology of Yuedu, provides people with a dream like experience; Although Alice herself was unable to attend, the puppet workshop exhibition area led by Penglai has the largest number of staff and no other equipment. With dolls alone, it is possible to achieve nanometer level accuracy, which makes people marvel at the power of electronic technology and automation; The Kappa's exihibition fully embodies the charm of heavy equipment, with the largest floor area among all exhibition areas, and it can be filled with heavy equipment without waste. The only drawback is the need to wear special protective clothing provided by the Kappa and be prepared for explosions at any time"
 nstouhou.23.a:0 "It's just a fancy trick"
 nstouhou.23.b:0 "This is the future"
 nstouhou.24.t:0 "Eientei Military Operation"
 nstouhou.24.d:0 "Recently, the reporter received a report that Yonglongting is conducting a large-scale military mobilization with unknown targets. The reporter immediately took action and found during a visit to the lost bamboo forest that the rabbit youkai that were once everywhere in the forest were now difficult to find, and a large area was designated as a military control zone. The spokesperson of Yongting responded that this is only a military exercise conducted to protect themselves in response to the current tense situation. However, the reporter found a large number of traces of large-scale mobilization of heavy armed forces, and the spokesperson of Yongting still insists that it is only a military exercise and there is no rhetoric against anyone"
 nstouhou.24.a:0 "Not surprising"
 nstouhou.25.t:0 "Eientei closes the border"
 nstouhou.25.d:0 "The Gensokyo Village Conference just concluded a month ago, and Eientei suddenly issued a ban, announcing the closure of the border and the expulsion of other races still lost in the bamboo forest. At present, the purpose of this move is not clear, although there are signs of military mobilization, it is concentrated towards Yongting, so the possibility of attacking other forces is not high. According to relevant sources' analysis, when the world first entered, abnormal fluctuations in space were observed in Eientei, and this series of abnormal behaviors in Eientei are likely related to it"
 nstouhou.25.a:0 "What's going to happen"
 nstouhou.26.t:0 "Red Demon Feast"
 nstouhou.26.d:0 "Today's Express; The Scarlet Devil Mansion has issued an invitation to all of Gensokyo to participate in the upcoming Scarlet Devil Banquet, which is open to everyone regardless of race, gender, or age. As one of the few forces in Gensokyo with the ability to hold the largest banquet, the Scarlet Devil Mansion held multiple banquets before entering this world, so this grand banquet also received widespread response. According to relevant sources' analysis, the Scarlet Devil Mansion opened its base to hold a grand banquet in such a tense environment to convey a signal to the outside world that it prefers fine wine over blood. Although the Scarlet Devil Mansion has always been a strong competitor for the hegemony of the demon power, judging from the banquet, they no longer have any plans to continue competing for supremacy"
 nstouhou.26.a:0 "To this final peace"
 nstouhou.27.t:0 "The Scarlet Devil Mansion claims hegemony"
 nstouhou.27.d:0 "Urgent news; As one of the two giants of the demon power in Gensokyo, the Scarlet Devil Mansion has issued a notice to the entire Gensokyo and claims to be the Lord of Gensokyo. Once the announcement was released, it caused a strong reaction in the Gensokyo, with only the races under the Scarlet Devil Mansion expressing support, while the human side strongly resisted, while many other races are still maintaining a wait-and-see attitude. However, another major giant of the demon power, the Tengu power, refused to respond to this matter"
 nstouhou.27.a:0 "The moon here is not yet bright red"
 nstouhou.28.t:0 "Moriya opens facilities to non believers"
 nstouhou.28.d:0 "At the beginning of Moriya's announcement that all branches under their umbrella would be open to believers of all religions for free, everyone believed that this was another new tactic of Moriya's persecution of infidels. However, earlier on, Byakuren Hijiri, the head of Myouren Temple, used the cable car provided by Moriya to return to Myouren Temple from the shrine, becoming the first non-believer to use Moriya's facilities. In fact, the Myouren Temple is not located near the Moriya Shrine. Passing through the Moriya Shrine will only increase the distance in vain, so this move has no practical significance. However, its symbolic significance is unprecedentedly enormous. Ms. Hijiri expressed that she is willing to believe that the actions of the Moriya Shrine are out of goodwill and is willing to prove it. This has also led to a new interpretation of the purpose of the Shouya Shrine policy by the outside world"
 nstouhou.28.a:0 "This will be much more convenient"
 nstouhou.29.t:0 "The swearing in ceremony of the Moriya believers"
 nstouhou.29.d:0 "Recently, a large-scale oath taking ceremony was held at the Moriya Shrine, and according to the investigation, all Moriya believers were required to attend. Although the journalist was denied entry and almost all participants refused to discuss the matter, some clues were still found through unremitting efforts. There is evidence to suggest that at the assembly, all the believers of Moriya took an oath, pledging to dedicate everything to the Moriya faith and contribute everything to the Moriya cause, for generations to come and for generations to come"
 nstouhou.29.a:0 "Moriya has always been good at this kind of thing"
 nstouhou.30.t:0 "Gensokyo Sightseeing Tour"
 nstouhou.30.d:0 "Recently, at the invitation of the Tengu, a joint sightseeing group composed of various forces from the Gensokyo officially entered the Youkai Mountain and began a three-day sightseeing and visit. The reporter learned that the tour route of this sightseeing group mainly focuses on the outskirts of Youkai Mountain and will not enter deeper areas. Related scholars say that this is an attempt by Tengu to change the completely closed and exclusive status quo of Tengu society. Youkai Mountain has always been known for its beautiful scenery and the fact that once you step in, you will be immediately expelled by Tengu. Therefore, it is surprising that Tengu took the initiative to invite foreigners to visit. In addition, our reporter found during our visit that there are many dissatisfied people in the Tengu Camp. Perhaps it is precisely because of this that the tour group chose the outer route. It seems that Tengu still needs some time to work hard to complete the opening"
 nstouhou.30.a:0 "Everything is very novel"
 nstouhou.31.t:0 "Comprehensive martial law"
 nstouhou.31.d:0 "Although no changes can be seen from the outside world, the journalist personally believes that it is still necessary to let the world know. Recently, Youkai Mountain has entered a state of emergency martial law and conscription. All citizens are under unified management, and no one is allowed to act without authorization. All foreigners in Youkai Mountain are expelled, and the freedom to use non lethal weapons and the limited threat of using lethal weapons are open to unarmed personnel. It seems that Tengu has officially prepared for war"
 nstouhou.31.a:0 "There really hasn't been much change"
 nstouhou.32.t:0 "Marissa visits friends"
 nstouhou.32.d:0 "Recently, during a visit to Xianglin Hall, the reporter found that the leader of Xianglin Hall, Miss Wu Yu Mo Lisha, was selecting accessories at the market. According to the merchants in the market, Miss Wu Yu has been frequently appearing at the market recently, picking various small things. According to informed sources, Miss Wuyu will recently conduct a visit to her friends that includes both official and private visits. However, due to the large number of candidates, some may be postponed. At present, the official itinerary has not been released yet, but these visits are already a certainty"
 nstouhou.32.a:0 "She has so many friends"
 nstouhou.33.t:0 "Massive theft"
 nstouhou.33.d:0 "Recently, during a visit to Xianglin Hall, reporters found that there seem to be frequent theft incidents among the surrounding forces, but the losses are minimal. Experts speculate that this incident was caused by a certain mage thief, but whether it was for practice, pre training, or simply due to unbearable itching is still unknown. However, according to the reporter's understanding, all forces have strengthened their security and are preparing to respond to threats"
 nstouhou.33.a:0 "Even at times like this"
 nstouhou.34.t:0 "The Rites of Myouren Temple"
 nstouhou.34.d:0 "Recently, the largest ritual in the history of Myouren Temple came to an end. This ritual was independently planned and organized by Myouren Temple, inviting members from all races in the Gensokyo, with the aim of comforting the many creatures who sacrificed themselves in the world's transformation. Although the relationship between humans and youkai was severely opposed due to the influence of the world, both sides exercised restraint during this ritual, so the ritual ended successfully without any unexpected incidents. After the ceremony, Myouren Temple also called on all parties to face differences, provide equal assistance, and move forward hand in hand"
 nstouhou.34.a:0 "Having good intentions in mind"
 nstouhou.35.t:0 "Martial monk cultivation"
 nstouhou.35.d:0 "Recently, during a visit by reporters, it was found that Myouren Temple and its surrounding areas have undergone large-scale renovations, with a large number of areas converted into martial arts fields, and a large number of disciples currently practicing. It is reported that the Myouren Temple has recently started to recruit disciples on a large scale and has placed the cultivation of martial monks in the top priority. Myouren Temple has always been committed to creating an equal environment for humans and youkai, and has always strived to solve problems through dialogue, so this move is truly puzzling"
 nstouhou.35.a:0 "If there are no people who create incidents, there will be no incidents"
 nstouhou.36.t:0 "Taoist goes down the mountain"
 nstouhou.36.d:0 "The reporter received a tip off claiming that a large number of Taoist priests had suddenly appeared among the people. After the reporter's visit, it was found that the vast majority of these Taoist priests come from the temple of gods and are practitioners of the temple. These Taoists provide assistance to humans regardless of their power, while persuading them to stay away from youkai, and even when facing youkai, they maintain great restraint. The Taoists had been practicing in seclusion in the temple of gods before, taking it as their duty to become immortals and never caring about worldly affairs. Therefore, this large-scale retreat was truly surprising"
 nstouhou.36.a:0 "Hanging teapots to benefit the world"
 nstouhou.37.t:0 "Summon the scattered immortals"
 nstouhou.37.d:0 "Recently, the anomalies observed within the territory of the Divine Spirit Mausoleum have been identified to be related to the various scattered hermits summoned by the Divine Spirit Mausoleum. Previously, the reporter also received a tip off that a large number of scattered hermits had flooded into the Hall of Dreams' Great Mausoleum, but it has always been known for its concept of human supremacy, so the reporter was not allowed to investigate further. According to relevant sources' analysis, the move by the Divine Spirit Mausoleum is mainly to respond to possible threats, and at the same time, it does not rule out the possibility of its proactive attack"
 nstouhou.37.a:0 "The Negative Sword Pacifies the World"
 nstouhou.38.t:0 "Religious Protection within People"
 nstouhou.38.d:0 "Recently, a public announcement has been released claiming to provide shelter and various privileges for followers of various religions. Human beings have always been the focus of competition among various forces, with youkai feeding on the fear they produce, and religious factions relying on them to provide faith and disciples. Of course, compared to youkai, people are more welcoming to religious forces that are also human. According to relevant sources' analysis, this move by Renli is mainly a self-defense measure against the escalating tension recently, by showing goodwill to major religious sects in order to gain greater support. However, in the current situation, major forces are struggling to protect themselves and cannot determine how much positive effect this move will bring. It can be foreseen that further actions will be taken within the people to win over all parties"
 nstouhou.38.a:0 "After all, it is the center of contention"
 nstouhou.39.t:0 "Religious Transformation within People"
 nstouhou.39.d:0 "Recently, the Religious Reform Act, which has attracted widespread attention and discussion, has been officially introduced. It includes multiple provisions such as a registration mechanism for believers, an assembly application bill, and a regulatory system for religious venues, indicating that people are beginning to regulate the actions of major religions. The spokesperson stated that this is a significant progress within the community. However, major religious forces have expressed that this is disrespectful to the gods. However, regardless, the bill has been officially promulgated among the people and is steadily progressing. According to insiders, this move by the people aims to change their previous situation of being controlled by others. Although they may lose the protection of religious power, they are prepared to deal with potential risks and challenges in the future"
 nstouhou.39.a:0 "It seems that they want to leave on their own"
 nstouhou.40.t:0 "Doll gifting"
 nstouhou.40.d:0 "Recently, major forces have received gifts from doll workshops, including exquisite dolls. Before the establishment of the Doll Workshop, Alice was renowned throughout Gensokyo for her stunning doll creations. There were also rumors that Alice's own beauty was not inferior to her dolls, but due to the dangerous environment of the Magic Forest, few people were able to see her true form. Later, the doll workshop was established, and Alice's dolls gradually began to enter the public eye, becoming one of the top gifts in high society. However, due to all the dolls being handmade by Alice herself, they have always been in short supply. According to incomplete statistics, the number of gifts presented this time is even larger than the total number sold or given away by doll workshops in the past decade. Although doll workshops have a tradition of giving doll gifts before, such a large scale is unprecedented. According to relevant sources' analysis, Alice's move is intended to ease the current tense situation as much as possible, and it is also a powerful counterattack against the widely circulated rumor that Alice has died recently"
 nstouhou.40.a:0 "The works of the puppet workshop are renowned for their excellence"
 nstouhou.41.t:0 "Dolls emerge"
 nstouhou.41.d:0 "Recently, there have been a large number of dolls of unknown origin appearing throughout the entire Gensokyo. Whether in dense forests or villages, whether in the sky or underwater, there are witnesses. According to eyewitnesses' accounts, the dolls often appear in corners that are not usually noticed, or in concealed places such as grass or piles of debris. Additionally, all eyewitnesses have stated that those dolls face outward and closely monitor everything that comes and goes. When someone notices them, they disappear at some point and return to the vicinity of the discovery site a few days later, although they often change positions and become more difficult to spot. Even some restricted or highly confidential areas have witnessed testimonies. At present, in order to avoid further leaks, several forces have started to search for these dolls. It's hard to imagine that such organized action would be spontaneous, but the puppet workshop still stated that it had nothing to do with it"

However, when the reporter arrived, the building was already empty. At present, the surrounding forces have completed the takeover of the area where the original Scarlet Debil Mansion belonged. According to the situation learned by the reporter, there are very few remaining blood clans that were originally quite active in the Scarlet Debil Mansion and its surrounding areas, and those who remain know nothing about this matter"

According to the information learned by the reporter, the patient has obvious symptoms of anemia and generally claims to have seen a blood red moon, so people named this disease Blood Moon Disease. The disease has caused a large number of deaths, but doctors are powerless to deal with it. Almost all countries where the epidemic broke out have fallen into chaos, and one of the most serious countries even went to war as a result. However, the country has not issued any statements, which is really puzzling"

Our great leader has received the love and support of all ethnic groups in Gensokyo, and has gained the support of various regions in Gensokyo. After hearing the news of the leader's appointment, the entire Gensokyo was boiling with excitement, and everyone spontaneously took to the streets to celebrate. This grand occasion reminds me of the days when the Supreme Leader led his confidants on a tour of Gensokyo and had friendly exchanges with heroes. Although there were occasional conflicts, they relied on the great charisma of the leader to win over people with virtue. Every time they visited a place, the locals would welcome them through the streets. The only one who can lead us is the Supreme Leader. Long live the leader! hooray! Ten thousand years old! In addition, all the rumors of protests, riots, rallies, etc. that you have heard are groundless. There is no one in the Gensokyo who does not support the newly appointed supreme leader. What you hear at home is not the sound of gunshots or cannons, but the excited people setting off firecrackers to celebrate, and the soaring flames are the bonfires of celebration. This newspaper kindly reminds readers to stay indoors, close doors and windows tightly. No matter how excited they are, please do not join the carnival outside until the new government's army takes you out of your house. Thank you for your cooperation"

According to the sages who just concluded the meeting, this energy does not belong to our world or this world, but rather comes from the power of the demon realm. According to an anonymous source, the Council of Wise Men had identified potential signs that could have led to the current situation a long time ago, but did not take any action. It is unclear whether this was due to an agreement between the Council of Wise Men and the council. At present, it is unclear what impact this incident will have on Gensokyo and the outside world. However, it is foreseeable that this world will not sit idly by in the face of the invasion of a god level power from another world"

However, we persevered and successfully waited until the demon realm arrived in this world. The advance troops from the demon realm had already arrived at the puppet workshop and were waiting to be dispatched. Subsequent support would also be continuously delivered.

 nstouhou.57.d:0 "Recently, a new trend of thought has emerged almost simultaneously among different groups in different countries. This new ideological trend is mainly based on egalitarianism and internationalism, with obvious communist colors, but it is different from all current communist theories and seems closer to the human society in the Bible, Old Testament, and Genesis. Its content is modern, even with advanced understanding of various social theories, but its core is quite ancient, even able to trace the description of the golden age shared by myths of various countries. It is difficult to imagine what kind of experience the original proposer had. The dissemination of this theory is likely to force countries to carry out internal and external reforms"

Yesterday at 4am, the demon realm invaded another country. The bomb suddenly appeared over the city and rained down on the sleeping innocent people's heads. I have signed another round of mobilization orders to send more young people to the battlefield, or more precisely, to hell. On the square, people surrounded me. I dare not lift my head - I am ashamed to look into the eyes of those mothers and wives. A young lady walked up to me, holding a child. I dare not speak out, I am afraid she will ask me when to send this child to hell - to see his father. She patted my shoulder, 'We can't give up yet.' She trembled, as if a piece of paper could be blown apart by the wind at any moment. The crowd dispersed, and everyone returned to their work posts. We will still crawl in the hellish reality, while our descendants will stand on the glorious land and be proud of us"
