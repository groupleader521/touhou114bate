 kappa.0.d:0 "Although there are several explosions at the Central Research Institute of [Root.GetName] every day, the one that occurred today was significantly more violent than the others, turning most of the area into ruins in just a few minutes. However, this is not surprising as all researchers evacuated with their research materials ten seconds before the explosion, resulting in no casualties.

It's just a pity about those devices. That being said, it's better to fix it quickly. The central factory is a symbol of creation for the Kappa"

 alice.0.t:0 "Activate the last spare doll"
 alice.0.d:0 "In the attempt to prevent the incident, almost all of the owner's dolls were lost and left unprotected, which is absolutely unacceptable. Fortunately, there was still one last item of dolls and equipment inventory that had not been put into use, and the owner immediately activated them after entering the world. Although the lack of reserve forces is unsettling, now is not the time to worry about that"
 alice.0.a:0 "The model is a bit old, but the quality of the owner's work is absolutely excellent"
 alice.1.t:0 "The Rise of the Puppet Liberation Front"
 alice.1.d:0 "Meitixin, who had been constantly harassing her owner in Gensokyo, has started to move again. If it were the usual owner who had absolute control over all the dolls, Medexin would never be able to stir up any storms. However, the current owner is too weak, and if left unattended, it will inevitably give her an opportunity to take advantage. However, if suppression begins, it is bound to have an impact on the recovery of the owner. Master, please give the order on what to do"
 alice.1.a:0 "Master's order, the recovery of the master is the top priority, don't worry about them"
 alice.1.b:0 "The master ordered the establishment of a special operations unit to suppress them"
 alice.2.t:0 "Alice is recovering"
 alice.2.d:0 "The magic concentration in this world is too low, and the owner's recovery state is not ideal, but it is indeed in the process of recovery. Due to the policy of placement, the power of Medicine is constantly increasing and has already had an impact in many aspects. Although as long as the master can fully recover, Medicine can be defeated by her alone, it is difficult to guarantee that Medicine will not engage in a decisive battle on the eve of the master's recovery. If so, the master will be very disadvantaged. Master, please give the order on what to do"
 alice.2.a:0 "The master has orders, and the master's recovery is the top priority. Don't bother with them"
 alice.2.b:0 "The master has ordered the establishment of a special operations unit to suppress them"
 alice.21.t:0 "Alice has recovered"
 alice.21.d:0 "After a long rest, the master finally regained his strength and once again held all the dolls in his hands, no matter how many they were or where they were. Medicine's actions ended in failure once again, leaving no trace of the past turmoil as if it didn't exist. Medicine herself also returned to the fragrant place of the Garden of the Sun once again. Yuuka Kazami, as a friend of the master from Makai until now, also took good care of Medicine at the master's request. The owner has always been fond of Medicine, although others and Medicine herself have no idea, but we puppets are all aware that the person who has been supporting the puppet's liberation front behind the scenes is the owner. Although this time was indeed very thrilling, the owner also had a great time playing"
 alice.21.a:0 "Our master has returned and handed over control to him. The self-discipline module has started to sleep indefinitely"
 alice.3.t:0 "Special Operations Department established"
 alice.3.d:0 "In order to deal with the turmoil caused by Medicine, the owner ordered the establishment of a special operations unit specifically to deal with Metishin's destructive actions. However, this will inevitably result in unplanned magic consumption, which will have a huge impact on the owner's recovery"
 alice.3.a:0 "Start taking action"
 alice.31.t:0 "Special Action"
 alice.31.d:0 "The Special Operations Department is ready to strike against Medicine. If they can be pushed to the brink, they can be forced to engage in a decisive battle with their master"
 alice.31.a:0 "Take action"
 alice.32.t:0 "The special operation was successful"
 alice.32.d:0 "This operation was successful, although it did not push Medicine to the brink, the puppet liberation front suffered a blow"
 alice.32.a:0 "Prepare for the next action"
 alice.33.t:0 "The special operation failed"
 alice.33.d:0 "This operation failed, and the puppet liberation front forces actually strengthened"
 alice.33.a:0 "Prepare for the next action"
 alice.34.t:0 "The final battle"
 alice.34.d:0 "Perhaps sensing the timing was right, perhaps being pushed to a dead end, or perhaps for some other reason, Medicine gathered all her strength and engaged in a decisive battle with her master. Although the owner has an advantage, at least they are on equal footing with Medexin, the world is unpredictable, and we can only do our best, even sacrificing our lives for the owner"
 alice.34.a:0 "Let's get started"
 alice.4.t:0 "Medicine has won"
 alice.4.d:0 "The master lost!? Medicine has won!? In the final battle, the master's performance was clearly abnormal, but no one except us - the master's confidants - could notice, as if the master had intentionally lost to her. After the victory, Medicine's performance in politics, military, diplomacy, industry, technology, and everything else was very poor, thanks to our assistance, there were no major problems. We will continue to assist Medicine, but we just don't want her to ruin the master's hard work. Furthermore, although everyone believed that the owner had passed away, only a few of us confidants knew that the owner was currently on vacation at Yuuka KAzami's place, and perhaps no longer needed to control all the dolls with precision. His recovery was even better than when he was at home"
 touhou_cosmetic_tag_doll:0 "Puppet Freedom Corps"
 alice.4.a:0 "We will serve you. (After all, it's the master's command.)"
 alice.5.t:0 "The master has won"
 alice.5.d:0 "In the final battle, the master naturally achieved an overwhelming victory. Medexin has failed again, and of course she will come back again and fail again, repeating this cycle until the owner is satisfied or there are other arrangements"
 alice.5.a:0 "Of course"
 alice.6.t:0 "Post war recovery"
 alice.6.d:0 "The Special Operations Department helped the master achieve victory, but in this world where magic is so scarce, even the extra consumed magic is very important, and the master has missed the good opportunity to recover. Although the owner is still trying to recover to a perfect state, the hope is slim"
 alice.6.a:0 "Pray for the master to recover"
 alice.61.t:0 "Recovery failed"
 alice.61.d:0 "The rarer magic makes it difficult for the owner to recover. This recovery failed, but the owner is still trying"

At present, the main points of controversy you are facing are; your legitimacy, and people suspect that you obtained your territory through despicable means; Your ability, although you have resolved many incidents, you are still a child and there are controversies in governing the country; Your purpose is that the youkai in your territory believe you are human and attempt to destroy them under the banner of equality, while humans believe you are a youkai and oppress them under the banner of equality"

Moreover, other forces seem to have also noticed the predicament of [Root.GetName], with both the Human faction and the youkai sending out large-scale notices expressing their willingness to provide assistance. Affected by the announcement, a large number of people began petition activities. However, the announcements from both sides were surprisingly consistent, and Why don't you take a look yourself; Ms. Marisa Kirisame, we have heard about your deeds and deeply agree. Your philosophy coincides with ours as humans (youkai). We understand that your current activities are not going smoothly, and we are willing to share our experience in governing the country with you, provide relevant personnel, and also provide you with soldiers and equipment.

The reason why we persist is also the reason why Mr. Xianglin will lend you Xianglin Hall. Those who questioned you have already left, and now those who remain are those who identify with your ideals or are attracted to you. We have persisted until now and will continue to persist. By the way, when counting the equipment, I found some somewhat special equipment and an anonymous card. Please take a look\" Marisa, you haven't changed at all.

This incident has overturned everything, and the common sense and rules of the past no longer exist. People are in a state of confusion and almost everyone is at risk. In such an environment, numerous ideological trends have erupted. These ideological trends are divided into three major factions.

Later, under the control of the demon world, he led the demon army and caused countless casualties. Today, we met with Freyer and expressed that the future will be the future of everyone, hoping that the human redemption army that breaks free from control can help us.

But his military talent is what we need. In the early stages of the war, he commanded the Alpha Raid and defeated the demon world for the first time. Afterwards, he was controlled by the demon world and caused huge casualties to our army. It was a godsend that we could use these to threaten him. Today, we met with Freyr and expressed that if he is willing to be our dog, we will use our power to pardon his crimes. I can't hold back anymore, laughing at my family. I wonder if what you're doing is no different from what I'm doing, right? You animals don't expect me to be a filial son and lick you, do you? Enter the dictionary!

This way, Gensokyo would become a hero in the fight against the demon world and establish a legitimate foothold in this world.

The aftershocks of this war are still ongoing. There is a significant mismatch between industrial structure and national demand in various countries, demands for new international status from peripheral countries, and controversies surrounding the handling of former demon states, all of which are issues everywhere. In the end, we decided to form a coalition government and the relatively neutral Gensokyo Township was elected as the first governing committee.
